## Introduction

<p>
Welcome to Lifty.

Lifty is my fourth and final project, part of the Code Institute, Full Stack Web Developer Course.

The purpose of this project was a build a full-stack site based around a business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. The technologies used for this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django. Stripe handles online test payments and Heroku Postgres as a relational database.

Lifty is a fictional brand, purchases on this project are accepted via Stripes test card details. For further information on which card number you should use, please refer to Stripe's official documentation.

## UXD - User Experience Design

<p>
A large part of the inspiration behind the planning for this project came from Code Institutes teaching course.

By keeping the user in mind throughout the design and development of the project, it would be easier to make the user experience a positive one.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes,

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane
</p>

## The Strategy Plane

- As a shopper, I want to be able to see a confirmation when a product is added to my shopping bag, so that I can avoid accidentally adding multiple quantities of the same item.
- As a shopper, I want to be able to view my bag, so that I can see what is in my bag and adjust quantities
#### Customers (Logged in) Stories
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to save my details, so that I can avoid retyping my details again.
- As a logged-in user, I want to have my past orders viewable, so that I can verify what my past order was and view the order number.
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to leave reviews on a product, so that other users may be able to benefit from my opinions on my purchase.
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to edit my reviews, so that I can amend any errors or in case I change my opinion.
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to add products to my wishlist, so that I can view those products later.
- As a logged-in user, I was to be able to remove products from my wishlist, so that my wishlist is only full of products I want to be saved.


My user stories were obtained by doing research into other stores and seeing how their sites ran. Harry my mentor in particular helped me to gauge what I would need to implement and what potentially could be left out or moved into a phase for later deployment.
